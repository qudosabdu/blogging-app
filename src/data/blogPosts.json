We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents background noise and technical language. Moreover it enables transcription multiple languages as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech processing.see all from this user...",
